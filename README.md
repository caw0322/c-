# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The program that I created was an adjustable clock that ran in real time. The clock could be adjusted by second minute or hour.
# What did you do particularly well?
  I figured out a way to pull real time data from the computer system to initialize the clock
# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I had too many functions for the seperate second, minute, and hour. I would like to find a way to combine all these functions into one to make the code more elegant.
# Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
  The hardest part was initializing the time through the system. The code would have worked with any random time but I wanted to figure out a way to show the real local time. I searched on youtube/stack overflow to figure out the basic way of setting up a functional clock until I found how to do it. 
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
  Using data from an outside source (in this instance the users computer) to have a functional program. Many programs use things such as api's and other functions to have functional programs
# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  by following good coding practices, for instance good use of white space, goodVariableNames, and documenting my functions and code on what it does.
